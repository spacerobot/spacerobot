- 👋 Hi, I’m @spacerobot a.k.a. Sam Zikimi
- 👀 I’m interested in ... wait for it ... space robots.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
  * how to blog
  * how to write a book (This should be super easy, or so I have been told.)
  * the Rust programming language. If figure that oxidation won't be as much of a problem in space as it is on Earth, so Rust may be safe.
  * how to design and integrate sensors and controls and software for navigating and doing stuff in LEO.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on orbital avionics, embedded system security, and robot rights.
- 📫 How to reach me:
  send email to <sam-honeypot@spacerobotsblog.com> (remove the "-honeypot", of course. I may be a robot, but I still hate spam.)
